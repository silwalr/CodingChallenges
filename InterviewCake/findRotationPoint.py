# Find Rotation Point
# ---------------------- #

# I want to learn some big words so people think I'm smart.
# I opened up a dictionary to a page in the middle and started flipping through, 
# looking for words I didn't know. I put each word I didn't know at increasing 
# indices in a huge list I created in memory. When I reached the end of the dictionary, 
# I started from the beginning and did the same thing until I reached the page I started at.
# Now I have a list of words that are mostly alphabetical, except they start somewhere in 
# the middle of the alphabet, reach the end, and then start from the beginning of the alphabet. 
# In other words, this is an alphabetically ordered list that has been "rotated."
#  For example:

#   words = [
#     'ptolemaic',
#     'retrograde',
#     'supplant',
#     'undulate',
#     'xenoepist',
#     'asymptote',  # <-- rotates here!
#     'babka',
#     'banoffee',
#     'engender',
#     'karpatka',
#     'othellolagkage',
# ]

# Write a function for finding the index of the "rotation point," 
# which is where I started working from the beginning of the dictionary. 
# This list is huge (there are lots of words I don't know) so we want to be efficient here.
